# in python there are 2 types of loops
# for and while

# for x in "Python":
#     print(x)

# for x in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
#     print(x)

# for x in range(2, 5):
#     print(x)

# for x in range(0, 10):
#     print(x)

# we can pass a 3rd argument -> step
# for x in range(0, 10, 2):
#     print(x)

# the range function does not return a list
print(range(5))  # range(0, 5)
print([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(type(range(5)))  # <class 'range'>
